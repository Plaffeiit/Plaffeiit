***Plaffeiite** is a variety of amber from the flysch of the Swiss Alps that has been known since the 19th century and is called plaffeiite after one of the dozen or so known localities (Plaffeien). The amber occurs in the rock in the form of grains and small lenses.* ([Wikipedia_DE](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaffeiit))
